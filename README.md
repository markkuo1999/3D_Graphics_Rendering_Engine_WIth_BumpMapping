In the realm of computer graphics, optimizing rendering time is
crucial, especially for tasks like PC gaming. Our paper introduces
a novel approach that combines two established techniques, bump
mapping and billboarding, to enhance 3D graphics rendering.
Billboarding, often used in rendering expansive landscapes,
involves strategically placing 2D images to represent 3D models.
By integrating bump mapping, we include additional details into
billboards, creating a compelling illusion of intricate 3D objects.
Our method streamlines the rendering process, particularly for
large models with high polygon counts, with significant
implications for improving computer graphics performance.
